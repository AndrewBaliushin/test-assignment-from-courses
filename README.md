# Test assignment: GUI App to work with text file #

This assignment is entrance examination for Java courses that I won't name to prevent cheating. 

##Task:##

1. Show GUI to user (instance of JFrame). GUI contains input field (Instance of JTextField), field for showing status messages (Instance of JTextArea). And next buttons:
Accept Input, Clear Input Field, Exit.

2. Open predetermined text file on launch.

3. User can enter arbitrary string to input field, clear that field and exit the application.

4. When Accept Button is pressed application reads from input field and writes this string to file if hat file doesn't contain that string (case insensitive). If such string is already in file then 
show user message about it.

5. App closes on Exit button.
